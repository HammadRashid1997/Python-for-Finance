## üîî Important
For my project, I have used google drive to mount the drive and then access the .csv files. However, you can do it directly as well by adding the .csv files in the folder directly availale on Google Colab. The code given below lets you mount your google drive on Google Colab Notebook and then access it.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
